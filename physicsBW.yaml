materials:
  friction_coeff:
    "wood" : 0.40
  density:
    "wood" : 0.60
  color:
    "wood" : "black"

environment:
  gravity_accel:
    "earth" : 9.81

# Assumptions:
# 1. We assume that this coefficient is only determined by the slope materials.
# 2. The volume density is used even we are simulating in 2-d cases.
units:
  friction_coeff : None
  density : "10^3 kg/m^3"
  gravity_accel : "m/s^2"
